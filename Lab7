# Functions

## Why?
There are many reasons to use functions, but there is a main reason for using functions; Reusability. Functions let us write code
in a manner so that we can easily reuse it 

## What does a function look like?
They have a name and parenthesis. Here are some examples that you may have seen before.
```python
print()
input()
range()
int()
float()
str()
upper()
lower()
len()
forward()
left()
right()
color()
 # Alot more 
```

## Defining a basic function
To define a function, the following syntax is used.
```python
//The function is called foo

def foo():
  # Insert as many commands as you want in here

```

## Executing a function (aka Calling a function)
To execute a function, use the following syntax.
```python
//Defined a function called foo that will print "Hello" when executed. However, defining is not the same as executing
def foo():
  print("Hello")

//To call a function, just use the name, followed by a pair of parenthesis.
foo() //Executes the function foo. This will result in a print statement, "Hello"

```

## Example functions (Without arguments)
Let us look as some example functions that have no inputs.
```python

//A function called sayHello. The function prints 'Hello'.
def sayHello():
  print("Hello")

//A function called printNurseryRhyme(). Prints out the lyrics from "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
def printNurseryRhyme():
  print("Twinkle Twinkle Little Star")
  print("How I wonder what you are.")
  print("Up above the world so high")
  print("Like a diamond in the sky")
  print("Twinkle, twinkle little star")
  print("How I wonder what you are")
```

## How to send something inside a function?
What about functions like len() and print()? You can put stuff inside it? How do I do that?

### This leads us to the concept of arguments.
Arguments are things that you can pass inside a function. Let us look at an example function called add().

```python
// The two arguments in this function are called x,y. We can now pass things inside to the function.
def add(x,y):
  print(x + y)
  
//We are calling add, but we are also passing in two values, 2 and 3.
add(2,3) //This will print 5
```

### How do arguments work?
Arguments are essentially variables, so...
```python
def add(x,y):
  print(x + y)
  
//When we call add(), we passed in 2 and 5.
add(2,5) //According to the definition of add, x = 2 and y = 5.
```

Another example

```python
//Defining a function called greet(). This has one argument called name
def greet(name):
  print("Hello", name)
  
//Calling greet, and passing in "Jack" as the first argument
greet("Jack") //According to the definition of greet(), name = "Jack"
