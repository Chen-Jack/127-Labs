# Functions


# Defining a function
To define a function, the following syntax is used.
```python
//The function is called foo
//The function takes two arguments
//The first argument is called x, the second argument is called y

def foo(x, y):
  # Insert as many commands as you want in here

```

# Executing a function
To execute a function, use the following syntax.
```python
//Defined a function called foo. However, this does not call it yet
def foo():
  print("Hello")

//To call a function, just use the name, followed by a pair of parenthesis.
foo() //Executes the function foo. This will result in a print statement, "Hello"

```

## Example functions (Without arguments)
Let us look as some example functions that have no inputs.
```python

//A function called sayHello. The function prints 'Hello'.
def sayHello():
  print("Hello")

//A function called printNurseryRhyme(). Prints out the lyrics from "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
def printNurseryRhyme():
  print("Twinkle Twinkle Little Star")
  print("How I wonder what you are.")
  print("Up above the world so high")
  print("Like a diamond in the sky")
  print("Twinkle, twinkle little star")
  print("How I wonder what you are")
```
